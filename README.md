# Beat Click
This is a part of Models and Theories of Human Computer Interaction course project. Beat Click is a system consisting of Android wearable and smartphone applications which captures images using the smartphone camera whenever the heart rate of the user changes. The objective here was to build a system that is aware of the user's context and supports implicit interaction with technology. The system captures memories (photographs) for the users on a hike without disrupting their hiking experience. The key idea is certain heart rate patterns are associated with a change in a person's disposition, and thus can be used as signals to capture important events a person experiences, while doing an activity (for e.g., hiking). The captured images along with associated heart rates and timestamps can also be analyzed post hoc to discover, visualize and document the changes in the users mood through a hike and the important events associated with these changes. On one hand this information can be used to automatically capture and filter important memories for the user, on the other hand this information can be used to tag locations on hiking trails that evoke certain moods.
